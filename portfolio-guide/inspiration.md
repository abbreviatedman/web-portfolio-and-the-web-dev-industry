# Inspiration

Here are some web dev portfolios you can look to as inspiration.

### Simple Portfolios

Simple doesn't mean plain, but it _does_ mean that the focus is on the content and the developer's work. These portfolios are clean, easy to navigate, and put the developer's work front and center.

It is a good idea to have a simple portfolio if you are just starting out. It is easy to maintain and update, and it is easy to navigate for potential employers.

### Complex Portfolios

Complex portfolios are more involved and can be more visually striking. They often include animations, interactive elements, and other features that make them stand out.

If you are more experienced and have a good grasp of web development, you can consider creating a more complex portfolio. Just be sure that the complexity doesn't overshadow your work. And remember that complex portfolios can be harder to maintain and update.

Even if you're able to create a complex portfolio, it's still a good idea to _start out_ with a simple one. You can always add complexity later, while if you focus on a complex portfolio from the start, you may find it overwhelming.

But even if you're not ready to create a complex portfolio, it can be helpful to look at these examples for inspiration!
