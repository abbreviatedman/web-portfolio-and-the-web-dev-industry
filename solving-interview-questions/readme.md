# Solving Interview Problems

Tips, strategies, and sample problems for the tech interview.

### How To Approach Interview Problems

1. **Understand the Problem**: Make sure you understand the problem before you start writing code. Ask clarifying questions if needed.
2. **Test Cases**: Make sure you understand the input and output requirements. Write down some test cases.
3. **Brute Force**: Start with a brute force solution. Write down the steps you would take to solve the problem in plain English.
4. **Optimize**: Once you have a working solution, think about how you can optimize it.
5. **Write Code**: Write the code for your optimized solution.
6. **Test**: Test your code with the test cases you wrote down earlier.
7. **Discuss**: Be prepared to discuss your solution with the interviewer.
8. **Practice**: Practice as many problems as you can to get better at solving them.

### How To Impress Interviewers

1. **Communicate**: Make sure you communicate your thought process to the interviewer. Talk through your solution and explain your reasoning.
2. **Ask Questions**: If you're not sure about something, ask questions. It's better to ask for clarification than to make assumptions.
3. **Test Cases**: Make sure you test your code with different test cases. This shows that you're thorough and care about the quality of your code.
4. **Optimize**: Try to optimize your solution. Interviewers are looking for candidates who can think critically and come up with efficient solutions.
